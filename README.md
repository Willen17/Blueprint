# Blueprint - Digital Picture Wall Planner

Blueprint is a digital picture wall planner that helps users create their ideal art wall. We offer an extensive collection of room backgrounds, frames and posters for users to simulate their home setting and visualize their desired picture wall. Users can also upload their own images for use as backgrounds or posters. 

This project is created with Next.js, Konva, Firebase, MUI, and deployed with Vercel.
